1️⃣ Go to Vercel & Create a New Project

    Visit Vercel Dashboard and log in.
    Click “New Project”.
    Select your GitHub repository (quizapp).
    Click "Import".

2️⃣ Configure the Deployment

    Root Directory → Select frontend (since your project has both backend & frontend).
    Framework Preset → Select Vite.
    Build & Output Settings:
        Install Command: npm install
        Build Command: npm run build
        Output Directory: dist
    Click Deploy.

3️⃣ Set Up Environment Variables (If Needed)

    If your frontend fetches data from the backend, go to Settings → Environment Variables and add:

    VITE_API_URL = https://quizapp-cmsl.onrender.com

    (or your correct backend URL)

4️⃣ Wait for Deployment & Get the Live Link

    Vercel will automatically deploy your frontend.
    After a few minutes, you'll get a Live URL like:

    https://quizapp.vercel.app

    If everything is correct, your frontend should work.
